grails-websockets-blackjack
===========================

This is an example project I made for Grails using websockets and AngularJS.

Install, share your URL with friends, and play a collaborated blackjack game!

Requires Grails version 2.4.0+ (Spring 4+)

This code exemplifies
1. hybrid usage of AngularJS / Grails GSP

2. Websockets and Ajax


Still left to do:
1. Conform the backend to Publisher/subscriber pattern

2. Might want to find a better alternative to "Thread.sleep" for enabling the timer

3. Track how many loses/wins per player
